# Kotlin REST

Using Kotlin and Retrofit, this is a simple demonstration of an MVC app that uses a REST API.

We are using OpenAI's ChatGPT API for this because of it's simple authentication.

It's using ChatGPT 3 Turbo. We only pass one message to it, so it's only got a memory of one chat message. You will need a valid API key and an OpenAI account with either credit or a prepaid ballance on it for API calls.

> [!WARNING]
> Your key will be saved on the device you enter it in.
> Your key will be displayed in plain text in the text box you enter it in, which is always visible in the app.
> Your key will appear in logcat in plain text.
